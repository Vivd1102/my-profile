You can make your own same portfolio with this template. Follow given steps -

3. Once you are done with hosting these files you can see your site with Profile info, experience, showcase, education, skills section with dummy data as "lorem ipsum..".
4. Just go to files inside assets folder and update json file, replace lorem ipsum with your information. There are 6 json files each for data showing on site for Profile info, experience, showcase, education, skills section.
5. If you dont wish to show any section go to assets/information.json file and disable the section.
